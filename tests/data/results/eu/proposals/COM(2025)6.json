According to the assessment by the ECDD, c arisoprodol ( IUPAC name:  (2RS)-2-[( c arbamoyloxy)methyl]-2-methylpentyl(1-methylethyl)carbamate ) is a centrally acting muscle relaxant used in the short term as an adjunct to symptomatic treatment of acute musculoskeletal disorders associated with painful muscle spasm . The potential for misuse of carisoprodol may be related to both its sedative effects and its capacity to enhance the effects of other substances. Thus, the sedative effects of carisoprodol can be potentiated when it is combined with benzodiazepines, opioids or alcohol. Prolonged or excessive use of carisoprodol can lead to dependence. Carisoprodol may be diverted from legitimate medical channels and enter the illicit market to be sold without proper medical supervision, increasing potential abuse and adverse consequences. Carisoprodol was pre-reviewed in 2001 at the 32 nd ECDD meeting. The Committee did not recommend critical review of carisoprodol at that time. Carisoprodol was further presented, discussed and pre-reviewed in 2023 at the 46 th ECDD meeting, where proceeding to critical review was recommended. Carisoprodol is a prescription medication and appears to be a licensed drug in several countries and territories. However, it is no longer used medically in Europe since the European Medicines Agency Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use suspended all marketing authorizations for carisoprodol throughout Europe. Carisoprodol has no known industrial use. There is sufficient evidence that carisoprodol is being or is likely to be abused and may constitute a public health and social problem warranting the placing of the substance under international control.
