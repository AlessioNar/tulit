Client
===============

The tulit Client library currently supports only the Cellar endpoint.

Some draft implementation were provided for Normattiva, LegiLux, and the Veneto Region, but as machine-readable endpoint are not sufficiently supported, they are to be considered only as provisional solutions, until such endpoints can be provided.
