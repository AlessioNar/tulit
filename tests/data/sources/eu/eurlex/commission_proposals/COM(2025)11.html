               <span>The Board of Governors oversees the management of the Foundation and ensures that the Foundation is working towards its goals. It comprises representatives of the Members of the Foundation. The Board of Governors is convened on regular sessions twice per year co-chaired by the Community of Latin American and the Caribbean States (CELAC) via its Pro Tempore Presidency and the European Union (EU) via the European External Action Service (EEAS). The Board of Governors acts in the presence of more than half of its Members from each region. It takes the decisions by consensus of the Members who are present.</span>

            <p class="Normal">
               <span>The Board of Governors is a body set up by an agreement, namely the Agreement establishing the EU-LAC International Foundation.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>The act which the Board of Governors is called upon to adopt constitutes an act having legal effects. The envisaged act has legal effects because it governs the employment conditions and defines the rights and obligations of the staff working for the EU-LAC International Foundation, which is legally represented by the Executive Director. </span>

               <span>Therefore, the procedural legal basis for the proposed decision is Article 218(9) TFEU.</span>

            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>The substantive legal basis for a decision under Article 218(9) TFEU depends primarily on the objective and content of the envisaged act in respect of which a position is taken on the Union's behalf. If the envisaged act pursues two aims or has two components and if one of those aims or components is identifiable as the main one, whereas the other is merely incidental, the decision under Article 218(9) TFEU must be founded on a single substantive legal basis, namely that required by the main or predominant aim or component.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>With regard to an envisaged act that simultaneously pursues a number of objectives, or that has several components, which are inseparably linked without one being incidental to the other, the substantive legal basis of a decision under Article 218(9) TFEU will have to include, exceptionally, the various corresponding legal bases.</span>

            <p class="Normal">
