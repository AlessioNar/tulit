            <p class="Normal">
               <span>Established pursuant to Article 18 of the Convention, the Conference of the Parties (COP) is the governing body of the Rotterdam Convention. This body normally meets every two years to monitor the implementation of the Convention. It also reviews chemicals brought forward for its consideration by the Chemical Review Committee (CRC).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>In accordance with Article 5(1) of the Convention, Parties are required to submit notifications of final regulatory action taken to ban or severely restrict the use of a chemical at national level. After receipt by the Secretariat of two such notifications on the same chemical from two Parties belonging to two different PIC regions, those notifications will be presented to the CRC. The CRC is to review those notifications against the criteria laid down in Annex II to the Convention and to adopt a recommendation as regards the listing of the respective chemical for consideration by the COP. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>In addition, any Party that is a developing country or a country with an economy in transition and that is experiencing problems caused by a severely hazardous pesticide formulation (SHPF) under conditions of use in its territory can propose to list that severely hazardous pesticide formulation in Annex III to the Convention in accordance with Article 6(1). The CRC is to review those proposals against the criteria laid down in Annex IV to the Convention and to adopt a recommendation as regards the listing of the respective SHPF for consideration by the COP.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>The procedure for adoption of amendments to the Convention is governed by Article 21 of the Convention, and the procedure for adoption and amendment of Annexes by Article 22. In accordance with Article 23 of the Convention, each party has one vote. However, regional economic integration organisations such as the EU exercise their right to vote with a number of votes equal to the number of their Member States that are parties to the Convention.</span>

               <span>The listing in Annex III has the effect that the chemicals will be subject to the Prior Informed Consent Procedure when internationally traded.

               <span>The substantive legal basis for a decision under Article 218(9) TFEU depends primarily on the objective and content of the envisaged act in respect of which a position is taken on the Union's behalf. If the envisaged act pursues two aims or has two components and if one of those aims or components is identifiable as the main one, whereas the other is merely incidental, the decision under Article 218(9) TFEU must be founded on a single substantive legal basis, namely that required by the main or predominant aim or component.</span>
